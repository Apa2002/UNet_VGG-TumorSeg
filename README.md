# UNet_VGG-TumorSeg
This project applies deep learning to brain tumor segmentation using the LGG MRI dataset from Kaggle. MRI scans of patients with Low-Grade Glioma were preprocessed and fed into a UNet-VGG16 hybrid model, where VGG16 acts as the encoder and a decoder reconstructs tumor masks. Training was performed with augmented data for up to 100 epoch.
